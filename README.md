## This folder contains rmd (R Markdown) file, used in our analysis of market for our XYZ, a retail company.

### Problem statement


XYZ is a nationwide retail chain that owns stores across most major cities in the U.S. Like many other businesses, XYZ has been severely affected by the decline in the sales because of Covid. My task here is to analyse the sales data of XYZ US wide and make recommendation based on regions, states and demographics to help boost XYZ sales. XYZ plans to open new stores, my recommendations can help XYZ decide on locations where they should open new stores to maximise their revenue stream.
